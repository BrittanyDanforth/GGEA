## 💡 Key Features

### Alex Relationship Tracking

```javascript
// Game tracks:
flags: {
  alex_alive: true/false,
  alex_saved: true/false,
  alex_best_friend_path: true/false,
  alex_dead: true/false,
  alex_looted: true/false,
  // ... many more
}

relationships: {
  Alex: -20 to +20 // Tracks trust/distrust
}
```

### No Loop Guarantee

- Hand-crafted scenes: Manually verified, no loops
- Procedural scenes: `g{i}` only links to `g{i+1}` through `g{i+8}` (always forward)
- Hubs: Exist but have multiple exits, no infinite returns
- Endings: Terminal states, no choices

### Route Separation

- Mutex flags prevent being Protector AND Warlord
- Setting `route_protector` clears all other route flags
- Proof system requires progression through acts
- No route mixing allowed
