## üì¶ Installation

### Step 1: Place the Script

2. Place it in `StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts`
3. Rename it to something like `TycoonShopUI` (optional)

### Step 2: Configure Product Data
Open the script and find the `ProductData` section around line 150. Replace the example IDs with your actual product IDs:

```lua
local ProductData = {
    cashPacks = {
        {
            id = YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE, -- Replace with your actual product ID
            amount = 1000,
            name = "Starter Pack",
            description = "Perfect for beginners",
            featured = true,
            rarity = "common",
            icon = "üí∞",
        },
        -- Add more cash packs...
    },
    
    gamePasses = {
        {
            id = YOUR_GAMEPASS_ID_HERE, -- Replace with your actual game pass ID
            name = "Auto Collect",
            description = "Automatically collects cash every minute",
            hasToggle = true,
            featured = true,
            icon = "‚ö°",
        },
        -- Add more game passes...
    },
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Server-Side Remotes (Optional)
Create a folder called `TycoonRemotes` in `ReplicatedStorage` with these RemoteEvents:

- `GamepassPurchased` (RemoteEvent) - Fired when a game pass is purchased
- `GrantProductCurrency` (RemoteEvent) - Fired when a product is purchased
- `AutoCollectToggle` (RemoteEvent) - For toggling auto-collect feature
- `GetAutoCollectState` (RemoteFunction) - For getting current auto-collect state

### Step 4: Customize Themes (Optional)
You can customize the color themes by modifying the `Theme.colors` section:

```lua
local Theme = {
    colors = {
        modern = {
            background = Color3.fromRGB(248, 250, 252),
            surface = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255),
            primary = Color3.fromRGB(99, 102, 241), -- Your brand color
            -- ... customize other colors
        },
        dark = {
            -- Dark theme colors
        },
    },
}
```

error = Color3.fromRGB(239, 68, 68), -- Red for error states
```

### Customizing Fonts
```lua
fonts = {
    primary = Enum.Font.Inter, -- Main font
    secondary = Enum.Font.Montserrat, -- Secondary font
    display = Enum.Font.Michroma, -- Headers and titles
},
```

### Adjusting Animations
```lua
-- Find animation calls and adjust duration/style:
animate(object, properties, 0.25, Enum.EasingStyle.Quart, Enum.EasingDirection.Out)
--                           ^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Breakpoints (Responsive Design)
```lua
local BREAKPOINTS = {
    mobile = 768,   -- Screens smaller than this are mobile
    tablet = 1024,  -- Between mobile and this is tablet
    desktop = 1280, -- Larger than tablet is desktop
}
```

### Cache Settings
```lua
-- Adjust cache durations (in seconds)
priceCache = Cache.new(300),     -- 5 minutes for prices
ownershipCache = Cache.new(60),  -- 1 minute for ownership
```

### Sound Settings
```lua
-- Disable sounds globally
settings = {
    soundEnabled = false, -- Set to false to disable all sounds
    animationsEnabled = true,
    theme = "modern",
},
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Shop doesn't open when clicking the button**
- Check the console for error messages
- Ensure the script is in `StarterPlayerScripts`
- Verify that the GUI is not being blocked by other scripts

**Prices show as "???"**
- Check that your product/game pass IDs are correct
- Ensure the items are published and for sale
- Check your internet connection (prices are fetched from Roblox)

**Items don't show as owned**
- Verify game pass IDs are correct
- Check that the game pass is published
- The ownership check might take a few seconds

**UI looks broken on mobile**
- The UI is responsive and should adapt automatically
- Try different device orientations
- Check if other GUIs are interfering

**Animations are laggy**
- Reduce the number of simultaneous animations
- Check if the device has performance limitations
- Consider disabling animations on lower-end devices

### Performance Optimization

**For large inventories (50+ items):**
```lua
-- Increase cache duration
priceCache = Cache.new(600), -- 10 minutes

-- Reduce animation frequency
-- Comment out rarity glow effects for legendary items
```

**For mobile optimization:**
```lua
-- Disable complex visual effects
settings = {
    animationsEnabled = false, -- Disable for better mobile performance
}
```

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

The shop includes built-in performance monitoring:

```lua
-- Access performance metrics
local metrics = shopManager.performanceMetrics
print("Cache hit rate:", metrics.cacheHitRate)
print("Render time:", metrics.renderTime)
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Server-Side Validation**: Always validate purchases on the server
2. **Product Processing**: Handle product purchases through `ProcessReceipt`
3. **Anti-Exploit**: Never trust client-side purchase confirmations
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for purchase attempts

## üöÄ Performance Tips

1. **Preload Assets**: The script automatically preloads sounds and icons
2. **Cache Management**: Prices and ownership are cached to reduce API calls
3. **Lazy Rendering**: Only visible items are rendered for optimal performance
4. **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of unused resources
