        id = 12345678,
        name = "New Product",
        icon = Icons.star,
        description = "Product description",
        tags = {"new", "featured"},
        price = 100, -- or nil for gamepasses
    }
}
```

### Changing Colors
Modify the Theme.colors object:
```lua
Theme.colors.primary = Color3.fromRGB(your, color, here)
```

### Adding New Icons
Update the Icons table with new asset IDs:
```lua
Icons.newIcon = "rbxassetid://123456789"
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Scale-based sizing**: Uses relative sizing (0-1) instead of fixed pixels

3. **Consistent spacing**: 8-point grid system throughout
4. **Loading states**: Shows loading indicators during async operations
5. **Error handling**: Graceful error recovery
6. **Memory management**: Proper cleanup on destroy

## Performance Considerations

- Animations use TweenService for optimal performance
- Search uses debouncing to prevent lag
- Icons and sounds are preloaded
- Unused UI elements are properly destroyed

## Security Features

- All purchases validated server-side
- No client-side currency manipulation
- Secure remote communication
- DataStore redundancy
- Transaction logging

## Future Enhancements

1. **Wishlist System**: Save products for later
2. **Purchase History**: View past transactions
3. **Gift System**: Send products to friends
4. **Seasonal Themes**: Holiday-specific UI themes
