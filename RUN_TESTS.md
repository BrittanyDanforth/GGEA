# How to Run the Debug Tests

## Problem Diagnosed

The following issues were found and fixed:

1. **Missing JavaScript file** - `MYSTORY.JAVASCRIPT` didn't exist (now created)
2. **Misleading file extension** - `FINAL_STORY.json` is actually a JavaScript file (contains `const STORY_DATABASE = {...}`)
3. **Loading order issues** - Tests ran before scripts were fully loaded

## Fixes Applied

✅ Created `MYSTORY.JAVASCRIPT` with the `ConsequenceGame` class
✅ Fixed script loading order in `debug_test.html`
✅ Recognized that `FINAL_STORY.json` is actually a JavaScript file (not JSON)
✅ Added proper initialization timing

## How to Run

You can now simply **open `debug_test.html` directly in your browser**! 

Since the "JSON" file is actually JavaScript, no web server is required (but using one is still recommended for production).

### Option 1: Direct (Simplest)
Just double-click `debug_test.html` or open it in your browser.

### Option 2: With Web Server (Recommended)

**Python:**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000/debug_test.html
```

**Node.js:**
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000/debug_test.html
```

**PHP:**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000/debug_test.html
```

## Expected Results

If everything works, you should see:
- ✓ STORY_DATABASE loaded
- ✓ 2159 scenes loaded
- ✓ All integration tests passing
- ✓ Game engine initialized

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken):
```html
<!-- Missing: MYSTORY.JAVASCRIPT file didn't exist! -->
<script src="FINAL_STORY.json"></script>
<script src="MYSTORY.JAVASCRIPT"></script> <!-- ❌ Error: file not found -->
<!-- Result: Uncaught ReferenceError: STORY_DATABASE is not defined -->
```

### After (Fixed):
```html
<script src="FINAL_STORY.json"></script>       <!-- ✅ Loads STORY_DATABASE -->
<script src="MYSTORY.JAVASCRIPT"></script>      <!-- ✅ Loads ConsequenceGame -->
<!-- Both files now exist and work together! -->
```

### Key Insight
`FINAL_STORY.json` is **NOT** actually JSON - it's a JavaScript file that defines:
```javascript
const STORY_DATABASE = { /* 2159 scenes */ };
```
So it can be loaded directly as a script tag!

## Files Created/Modified

- ✅ **Created**: `MYSTORY.JAVASCRIPT` - Game engine with ConsequenceGame class
- ✅ **Modified**: `debug_test.html` - Fixed JSON loading and async test execution
- ✅ **Created**: `RUN_TESTS.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. Start a local web server (see options above)
2. Open the debug_test.html in your browser
3. Check the console for detailed test results
4. All tests should now pass!
